# Open-Source Contribution License

A permissive open-source license which require users of your work to contribute
to any open-source work in some way.

## Background

I love permissive open-source work. The projects help us create new services,
products and much more. A lot of people and companies try their best to
contribute back to the community, which is great, we just need more of it.

I want to create a license for open-source work that will require users of the
projects using this license to contribute to any open-source work in any way
they can.

Let's find a way to make paying it forward the norm. Where would your startup or
product be today without open-source? Would you be able to ship a new product in
a few months without using open-source projects?

# License

License text can be found in [LICENSE.md]

## Examples

Companies using open-source projects with this license could have a public
open-source policy, which would show how they contribute to open-source.

A person/company creating a project/product using an open-source project with
this license finds a bug in the open-source project should takes the time to
submit an pull-request to fix that bug instead of just fixing it locally.

## Goal

I hope that this license or a similar license will become the most popular
license used by open-source projects to help open-source in general getting more
contributions of any kind.
