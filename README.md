# The open-source license

A permissive open-source license which require "users" of your "work" to contribute
to any open-source project in some way.

## Background

I love permissive open-source work. The projects help us create new services, products
and much more. A lot of people and companies try their best to contribute back to to
the community, which is great. We just need more of it.

I want to try and create a license for open-source work that will require users of
the projects using this license to contribute to open-source in any way they can.

Let's find a way to make paying it forward the norm. Where would your startup be without open-source?
Would you be able to ship a new product in a few months without using open-source projects?

## Examples

e.g. Companies using open-source projects with this license need to have
a public open-source policy, which show how they contribute to open-source.

e.g. A person creating a startup using any open-source project, finds a bug
in the project, takes the time to submit a pull-request to fix that bug instead
of just fixing it locally in his product.

## Goal

I hope this this license or a license like this will become the most popular license
used by open-source projects.
